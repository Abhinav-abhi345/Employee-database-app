# Employee-database-app
The Java code is a console-based Employee Database Application that uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an employees table. It starts by establishing a connection using DriverManager.getConnection, then continuously prompts the user with a menu to either add a new employee, view all employees, update existing employee details, or delete an employee by ID. It uses PreparedStatement to securely insert, update, and delete records, and ResultSet to retrieve and display employee data from the database. The application handles input via Scanner and ensures the database connection is closed gracefully when the user chooses to exit.
